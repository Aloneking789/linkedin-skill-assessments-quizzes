The most appropriate action to take in this situation as a Scrum Master is to:

`Share your observation with the team and invite them to own and solve the problem.`

In summary, encourage open communication within the team and involve them in problem-solving
to find a solution that works best for their specific context and helps address the issue of
disinterest in certain stories.
