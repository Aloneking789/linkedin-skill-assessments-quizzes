The JSON structure you provided appears to be syntactically correct. It consists of a JSON object with two key-value pairs:

"series" with the value "Star Trek"
"episodes" with the value "The Trouble with Tribbles"

***************************************************************************************************************************************
Typically, you might use an array to represent a list of items like episodes. Here's how you could represent it in a more typical way:
{
  "series": "Star Trek",
  "episodes": ["The Trouble with Tribbles"]
}
In this revised JSON structure, the "episodes" key maps to an array, allowing you to list multiple episodes if needed.
