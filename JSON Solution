In JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), you can use a minus (-) sign to represent negative numbers,
but you typically do not use a plus (+) sign for positive numbers. JSON represents positive numbers without any sign.

For example, in JSON:

- Positive number: `42`
- Negative number: `-42`

So, the answer to your question is "yes" for using a minus sign to represent negative numbers in JSON,
but it's not common to use a plus sign for positive numbers in JSON because positive numbers are represented
without any sign.
