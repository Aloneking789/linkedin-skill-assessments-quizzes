#### Q161. Which of the following represents the time complexity of an algorithm?

- [ ] O(N*N)
- [ ] O(1)
- [ ] O(A+B)
- [x] O(A*B)

**Reasoning:** The answer option 'O(AB)' should be corrected to 'O(A*B)' to accurately represent the time complexity. 

- O(N*N): This represents a quadratic time complexity, where the running time grows with the square of the input size.
- O(1): This represents constant time complexity, indicating that the algorithm's running time doesn't depend on the input size.
- O(A+B): This represents linear time complexity, indicating that the running time scales linearly with the sum of values A and B.
- O(A*B): This represents quadratic time complexity, indicating that the running time scales quadratically with the product of values A and B.

`The original answer option 'O(AB)' is incorrect as it does not properly represent a known time complexity notation. The correct notation should be 'O(A*B)' to indicate quadratic time complexity.`
